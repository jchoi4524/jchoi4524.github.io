        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        
        <h3>Do I need to pay Ontario Science Centre's admission to come to this contest?</h3>
        <p>No. The contest hall is located outside of the Centre's admission required areas. If you are coming just for this contest and are not planning to visit the Centre's exhibits, you do not need to pay admission.</p>
        
        <h3>I don't live in Canada / I recently moved to Canada / I have dual citizenship. Can I compete?</h3>
        <p>To compete in Canadian Championship divisions, you must have lived in Canada for at least 1 year. Otherwise, you can only compete in International division.</p>
        
        <p>For those with dual citizenships, please keep <a href="http://iyyf.org/rules/seeding-rule/" target="_blank">IYYF's seeding rules</a>
        in mind when competing in another national contest. The International division in Canadian Nationals is
        <strong>not</strong> a championship division.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions about your eligibility, please <a href="mailto:canadianyoyoassociation@gmail.com">contact the organizer</a> directly.
        
        <h3>What is the format of the contest?</h3>
        <p>Each competitor will perform a freestyle trick routine on stage with music of choice. See <a href="rules.html">rules</a> for more details.
        A panel of judges will give scores to each routine in accordance to  
        <a target="_blank" href="http://iyyf.org/rules/wyyc2017-contest-rule/freestyle-rule-2017/">IYYF's guidelines</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Are there age restrictions or divisions?</h3>
        <p>No. There are no age restrictions. Everyone regardless of age will compete together in their registered divisions.</p>
        
        <h3>What are 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A?</h3>
        <p>These are the five major styles of competitive play. See <a href="http://yoyoexpert.com/learn/002-basic-five-styles.php" target="_blank">this video</a> for a quick overview.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What is "Open" division?</h3>
        <p>Open division is where competitors can perform any style that is not 1A. In other words,
        any one of 2A, 3A, 4A, or 5A is allowed. You need to choose which one as you register.
        </p>
        
        <h3>I am competing in Canadian 1A division. When I upload music, what are "prelim" and "final"? Do I need to upload to both?</h3>
        <p>The Canadian 1A division is typically so popular (and competitive!) that a preliminary round is needed to select only the top competitors to advance to the final round. This is why all Canadian 1A competitors (except seeds) should prepare to perform freestyles and upload music for both preliminary and final rounds.
        </p>
        <p>However, if there are too few competitors in the division, then everyone will automatically enter the final round. If this happens, it  will be announced shortly after the registration deadline.
